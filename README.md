# gong-python
this is a repository initially created to versioning a python script used to play an arduino-actuated-Gong with Home Assistant.
Then, it became a backup for all the scripts and Home Assistant integrations I worked on:

- enOcean
- KNX
- Dali over Wifi
- Dali over BLE
- Jaalee ibeacon button
- Jaalee ibeacon temperature sensor
- nmap based location tracking
- IFTTT
- Slack integration
- Osram Ligthify
- Lifx
- Philips Hue
- Sonos
- Home Automation

The main configuration is stored in `configuration.yaml`.
In the main folder all the scripts developed to test the device fuctionality are present.
the folders contains Home Assistant integrations.
